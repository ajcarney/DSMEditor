Verification is driven by test cases that are captured in QASE:
  https://app.qase.io/project/DSMED

The QASE project is currently private. Test runs are not saved for long term in the free version of this tool. We are considering moving testing to another platform.

Various test dsm files representing the state of the DSM at the end of each test case are contained in this folder. These can be useful examples to show how the tool
works.

Future test coverage that needs to be added is listed as follows:
  Propagation testing for counting by weight
  Cluster analysis
